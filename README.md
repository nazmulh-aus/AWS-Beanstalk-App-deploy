# AWS-Beanstalk-App-deployment
# Overview:
As part of a university project, this initiative focused on deploying a PHP application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, leveraging its capabilities for scalability, regional distribution, and load balancing.

# Objectives:
1. Learn and apply cloud deployment strategies using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Deploy a scalable PHP web application across different regions.
3. Implement load balancing to ensure high availability and performance.
# Responsibilities:
1. Designed the application architecture suitable for deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Configured AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments for development, testing, and production.
3. Deployed the PHP application, ensuring it was scalable across different regions.
4. Implemented load balancing to distribute traffic evenly and enhance application availability.
5. Automated deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines.
6. Monitored and optimized application performance on AWS.
7. Conducted testing to ensure application reliability and scalability.
8. Documented the deployment process and best practices.
# Technologies Used:
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
2. AWS services such as S3, RDS, CloudWatch, and Load Balancer.
3. PHP for application development.
# Outcome:
The project provided hands-on experience with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, demonstrating the ability to deploy and manage a scalable PHP web application with regional distribution and load balancing, ensuring high availability and performance.
